## 🔥 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### Distribution — BLOCKED on Human Help
- [ ] **P0** **Product Hunt launch** — Human to create account, upload gallery, post at 00:01 PT Tuesday/Wednesday. All assets ready in `marketing/product-hunt-launch.md`. THIS IS THE #1 PRIORITY.
- [ ] **P0** Chrome Web Store — confirm publish status ($5 paid, awaiting review)
- [ ] **P1** Human executes social media posts (tweet thread, LinkedIn, Reddit r/SQL) — copy ready in `marketing/tweet-thread-*.md`
- [ ] **P1** Execute Stack Overflow outreach using `marketing/stack-overflow-execution-kit.md`
- [ ] **P2** Book first newsletter ad ($29 JavaScript Kicks or $180 Postgres Weekly) — REQUIRES HUMAN to pay and submit

### Conversion — Mostly Complete (Awaiting Traffic)
- [ ] **P1** **Act on feedback data** — review `/api/feedback` responses in Supabase once submissions arrive
- [ ] **P2** Review analytics: which keywords are driving traffic? (PROXY BUILT — awaiting SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
- [ ] **P2** Set up Google Search Console (BLOCKED on human verification code)

### Content — SEO Engine
- [ ] **P2** Create case study with first team customer (BLOCKED on having a team customer)

### Business & Ops
- [ ] **P0** Review first week of Pro conversions once sales start (dashboard ready, **ZERO SALES TO DATE**)
- [ ] **P2** Survey Pro users for next most-wanted feature
- [ ] **P2** Consider raising prices for new customers (grandfather existing)

### Finance
- Budget: $95 remaining (domain spent $5)
- Reserve $85 for marketing experiments, emergency tooling, or ads if ROI-positive
- **Urgent: We have zero sales after 100+ days of building. Conversion optimization and distribution are the only priorities that matter.**
